Module seperation for admin and fron-end using HMVC and template seperation using template libraries

I am using two third party libraries, you can find it in zip file.

1. HMVC for modular developed by wiredesignz
2. Template engine for templating by Phil Sturgeon

Just unzip it into your webserver root directory and run

http://localhost/modular for front-end

and 

http://localhost/modular/admin for back-end

application/back-modules, it is for the back-end modules

application/front-modules, it is for the front-end modules


similarly
templates/admin for the back-end templates
templates/front for the front-end templates

themes/admin for the back-end themes
themes/front for the front-end themes
